Please note: This is a GEOPOL CREATION KIT, it is designed to act as a template for a new geopol. Therefore, it is incomplete in some aspects (dynmap, voting, ddos protection, monetization, etc.) and some details may not be to your needs. Please review every config and the luckperms permissions so that everything currently provided is acceptable to you, feel free to fork it with your changes.

# Basic setup
Create a folder and add the server jar (built with paper 1.18.2 in mind). 
Add plugin config folders and server properties files to the server. Review the pluginlist text document for the links to all needed plugins and acquire said plugins. 
Download and add the earth map (linked in the maps text document) along with using worldpainter to build the custom planet maps (provided in the planets folder). 
Run startup script and let server unpack. Make necessary config changes and add new plugins or features at will.



# Misc info:
Use either noobprotector or the combatlogx newbiehelper expansion for protecting new players

Mythicmobs mob removal on other planets may not work, perhaps use mob managers as well, unknown if that affects custom mob spawning on planets

gamerule reducedDebugInfo can be set to true to reduce f3 information players can get

if a player is invincible, they probably have an invincibility tag assigned to them, check your player data files and delete their file after they back up their gear.
