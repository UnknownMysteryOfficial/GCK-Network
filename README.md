Please note: This is a GEOPOL CREATION KIT, it is designed to act as a template for a new geopol. Therefore, it is incomplete in some aspects (dynmap, voting, ddos protection, monetization, etc.) and some details may not be to your needs. Please review every config and the luckperms permissions so that everything currently provided is acceptable to you, feel free to fork it with your changes.

Misc info:
Use either noobprotector or the combatlogx newbiehelper expansion for protecting new players

Mythicmobs mob removal on other planets may not work, perhaps use mob managers as well, unknown if that affects custom mob spawning on planets

gamerule reducedDebugInfo can be set to true to reduce f3 information players can get

if a player is invincible, they probably have an invincibility tag assigned to them, check your player data files and delete their file after they back up their gear.
