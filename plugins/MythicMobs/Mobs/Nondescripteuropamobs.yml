# Not done currently, ideas for the mobs to implement

# Some guardian based mob that would spawn in the europan spheres, drops nether stars and guardian heads

# Bishop and disciple squids: Glowing squid (bishop) that when approached by player dies and spawns 2-4 disciple normal squids that attack the player.

# dolphins with the guardian beam that attack players and entities
