battle_session_scheduler:
  
  # The entries in this section determine the start times (in server timezone), of battle sessions.
  # By default, battle sessions start only on Saturday and Sunday, except for one early morning Monday entry to accommodate Sunday evening in later timezones.
  # Each entry is in the format HOUR:MINUTE.
  # TIP 1: Less battles is bigger battles --> A handful of well placed battle session times will generate bigger battles, by allowing multiple players to synchronize their online fight times.
  # TIP 2: Less fight-time is less-toxic players --> With default settings, an individual player can fight in sieges for a total of 7 hours a week. Be wary of making more fight time available, as it can increase toxicity.
  start_times:
    saturday: 03:00,11:00,19:00

peaceful_towns:
  
  # If this is true, then a town can toggle peacefulness using /t toggle peaceful,
  # 
  # By activating peacefulness, a town receives complete immunity from attack.
  # 
  # EFFECTS:
  # - Town is immune to siege attack (but not to SiegeZone-forced-PVP from nearby sieges).
  # - Residents cannot get nation military ranks.
  # - Town is vulnerable to getting instantly subverted (captured and occupied).
  #   (see user guide for full details)
  #
  enabled: 'true'
  
  # If this is true, a nation capital can be a peaceful town. If false, any capital will not be able to turn peaceful.
  nation_capital_can_be_peaceful: 'false'
  
  # If this is true, all new towns will be peaceful when created.

  # This value determines how long it takes to confirm a town peacefulness status change.
  confirmation_requirement_time_days: '7'
  
  # This setting applies only in the first week after a town is founded.
  # The value determines the countdown duration to be applied to any peacefulness switch.
  new_town_confirmation_requirement_days: '2'
  
  # If this is true, peaceful towns have a public spawn.
  # 
  # TIP 1:
  # In Towny in 2023, many peaceful-builder players have a Critical Requirement to own public spawns,
  # so that they can run-shops/demonstrate-builds.
  # In Servers configured for public /n spawns, but no public /t spawns, players often create 'Shell Nations',
  # which they use just for the /n spawns.
  # SiegeWar cannot/will-not protect 'Shell Nations',
  # Thus, if your server is configured as indicated, set this value to 'true' to meet a critical requirement for peaceful-builder players.
  #
  # TIP 2:
  # In Towny in 2023, the reason some servers disable public /t spawns, is to encourage 'infastructure' between towns.
  # While this is an interesting goal, it is probably not as important as meeting the critical player requirement outlined above,
  # Thus although this feature could potentially interfere with infrastructure,
  # the problems it solves are probably more important than the problems it creates

  # TIP 3: This help keep the server geopolitics sustainable, as powerful nations will snowball less.
